# Zensh

Using [this as a base configuration](https://github.com/dreamsofautonomy/zensh) to create personalised zshrc for following two environments:

#### 1. Raspberry PI
Raspbian OS does not support the [latest version of fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#linux-packages). For this specific usecase, we will disable fzf.

#### 2. Ubuntu/MacOS latest
No specific handling needed here.

### Pre-requisites
1. Install (Nerd Fonts)[https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases]
2. Install fzf (if supported)
3. Install zoxide

### To-do
1. For native environments, install nerd fonts implicitly
